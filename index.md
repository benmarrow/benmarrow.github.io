I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://financialeconomics.uchicago.edu">Joint Program in Finance & Economics</a> between the University of Chicago and the Booth School of Business.


Previously, I worked as a Senior Research Analyst in the Capital Markets Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I received my BA from Yale in 2017 in Ethics, Politics, & Economics.
