## Miscellaneous


* **Activities**
	* I am a co-organizer the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/behavioral-finance-group/">Behavioral Finance Reading Group</a> for Fall 2023
	* I am actively involved with the <a href="https://www.paideiainstitute.org/">Paideia Institute</a>
	* I serve on the Booth Standing Committee on PhD Climate, 2023-2024
	* I play for the UChicago Intercollegiate Chess Team

<br>

* **Software**
	* I coded up a Twitter bot, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/everyFREDgraph">@EveryFredGraph</a>, that tweets every graph from the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)</a> data series. [Note: unfortunately this was shut down when Twitter blocked bots and Heroku started charging money to deploy web apps]
	* I coded up a "free bet" <a href="https://benmarrow.shinyapps.io/free_bet_converter/">converter</a> to convert free bet promotions into risk-free payouts, given transaction costs and margin constraints. (See <a href="https://benmarrow.notion.site/Optimal-Sports-Betting-Pt-2-Free-Bets-and-Risk-Free-Bets-958c1e0df6f54046959ed0df592a0b7f?pvs=4">this post</a> for a high-level overview)
