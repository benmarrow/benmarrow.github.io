<span style="color:gray; font-size:0.3;">Over the last 60 years, the literature has documented a negative correlation between stock returns and realized inflation. Under the joint hypothesis, the negative correlation implies the puzzling conclusion that stock prices carry a negative inflation insurance premium. We directly measure subjective inflation expectations and use high-frequency identification to show that stock prices carry a robust and stable positive premium. We find that this effect is driven primarily by changes in risk premia, rather than through an interest rate or cashflow channel. Overall, our causal estimates suggest that stocks are a hedge against changes in inflation expectations, and so stocks will hedge realized inflation when it is driven predominantly by changes in expectations. Finally, we revisit the negative correlation between returns and realized inflation documented in the literature. We estimate the correlation has turned positive since 2000, suggesting that stocks have been an inflation hedge in recent decades.</span>

<span style="color:gray; font-size:0.3;">We use a New Keynesian model with an effective lower bound (ELB) and a general stochastic process for the natural rate to study optimal monetary policy. The central bank has perfect commitment and an interest rate smoothing term in its loss function. Despite the ELB binding occasionally and endogenously, we can derive a closed-form solution for the optimal interest rate: it is the maximum of zero and a weighted average of all past realizations of the output gap. This implies that the optimal interest rate (i) takes a simple form, (ii) is path dependent at all times, (iii) should be pre-emptively lowered when close to the ELB — or kept at zero if at the ELB — if and only if the weighted average of past output gaps is negative, and (iv) behaves very differently from the Taylor rule. We illustrate these insights by solving for key variables in the New Keynesian model using a neural network.</span>
