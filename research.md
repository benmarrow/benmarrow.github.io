   The Pricing of Earnings News

<span style="color:gray; font-size:70%;">How does earnings news get priced into stock returns? I use a demand-system approach to show that this passthrough depends on investor responses to both earnings and prices and that these sensitivities are heterogeneous in the cross-section of investors. A key challenge in identifying these sensitivities is that earnings news is rapidly incorporated into prices; as a result, it is difficult to distinguish whether investors react to the earnings news itself or the concurrent price change. I introduce a two-step procedure based on market-clearing logic to identify earnings elasticities in the presence of this price contamination: by adjusting each investor's general equilibrium response to earnings news for the counterfactual price response. The estimated demand system indicates that the asset-weighted earnings elasticity averages around 3, i.e. for a stock that beats earnings expectations by 1%, the average investor would increase the number of shares he holds by 3% if prices were held fixed. However, these estimates vary significantly across sectors: institutional investors show high sensitivity to earnings news and small responses to prices, while the residual "household" sector displays the opposite behavior. Stock-level measures of earnings and price sensitivity, derived from averaging investor-level elasticities within-stock, explain earnings-related asset pricing patterns. First, stock-level elasticities can account for heterogeneous earnings passthrough, as stocks with higher earnings sensitivity or lower price sensitivity see stronger return responses from the same earnings surprise. Second, extremes of price and earnings elasticities are closely related to over- and under-reaction: a strategy that bets on subsequent reversal (momentum) in sensitive (insensitive) stocks in response to earnings news generates significant outperformance and alpha. These findings suggest that the pricing of earnings news is closely related to the ownership structure of stocks.</span>

<span style="color:gray; font-size:70%;">Do stocks protect against rising inflation expectations? We directly measure investors' expectations using traded inflation-indexed contracts and show that, post-2000, stocks offer positive returns in response to higher expected inflation: unconditionally, a 10 basis point increase in 10-year breakeven inflation is associated with a 1.1% increase in the value-weighted stock index. Using high-frequency identification around scheduled CPI releases, we show this relationship is likely causal. We provide evidence that the price increase is driven by lowering future expected excess returns rather than changing risk-free rates or cashflows: (1) in the cross-section, return responses are almost completely explained by CAPM beta but not by cashflow or leverage related variables, (2) VAR decompositions of returns as well as mediation regressions that directly control for alternate channels attribute nearly all the changes to expected excess returns. Finally, we show inflation expectations predict future output, suggesting that investors may use information about high future inflation as a signal for economic growth, thereby lowering risk premia.</span>

<span style="color:gray; font-size:70%;">In frictionless markets, interest rates across various loan products should not differ within borrower, at the same point in time. This paper documents the existence of persistent, loan-level discounts to firms, identified as the difference between spreads on institutional investor-held loans and loans held by banks. Within a loan package -- loans offered to the same firm at the same time -- institutional term loans command a spread 64 basis points above revolving loans and 61 basis points above term loans. We show the discounts are not driven solely by loan characteristics, bid ask spreads, or upward sloping supply curves. Instead we use our measure to test theories of banking relationships and loan pricing. Discounts are higher when no previous banking relationship exists with the borrowing firm, and public borrowers receive higher initial discounts and have steeper declines in the discount over the course of the banking relationship, relative to private borrowers. We propose and provide evidence for a cross-selling model of the pricing of banking services, where banks price services with the impacts on other lines of business in mind. We show that initial discounts are highest to public firms, consistent with greater competition for firms with high likelihood of other banking service needs, and that having previous banking relationships are associated with a greater likelihood of future hiring for all types of banking services.</span>

<span style="color:gray; font-size:70%;">We use a New Keynesian model with an effective lower bound (ELB) and a general stochastic process for the natural rate to study optimal monetary policy. The central bank has perfect commitment and an interest rate smoothing term in its loss function. Despite the ELB binding occasionally and endogenously, we can derive a closed-form solution for the optimal interest rate: it is the maximum of zero and a weighted average of all past realizations of the output gap. This implies that the optimal interest rate (i) takes a simple form, (ii) is path dependent at all times, (iii) should be pre-emptively lowered when close to the ELB — or kept at zero if at the ELB — if and only if the weighted average of past output gaps is negative, and (iv) behaves very differently from the Taylor rule. We illustrate these insights by solving for key variables in the New Keynesian model using a neural network.</span>
