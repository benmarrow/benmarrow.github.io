      I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://financialeconomics.uchicago.edu">Joint Program in Finance & Economics</a> between the University of Chicago and the Booth School of Business. 
      My research interests span empirical asset pricing, behavioral and institutional finance, and household finance.
