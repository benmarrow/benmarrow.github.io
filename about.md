I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://financialeconomics.uchicago.edu">Joint Program in Finance & Economics</a> between the University of Chicago and the Booth School of Business. My research interests span empirical asset pricing, behavioral/household finance, retail investing, and corporate finance.



Previously, I worked as a Senior Research Analyst in the Capital Markets Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I have also worked as a Quantitative Analysis Associate for the New York Yankees, conducting sports analytics (sabermetrics) for the front office. I received my BA from Yale in 2017 in Ethics, Politics, & Economics.
