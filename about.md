I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://financialeconomics.uchicago.edu">Joint Program in Finance & Economics</a> between the University of Chicago and the Booth School of Business.


Previously, I worked as a Senior Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where I helped economists in the Capital Markets group conduct research on <a href = "https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr879.pdf">corporate</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr645.pdf">macro</a> finance.
